'WAM Calculator' will allow students to enter their subject marks and caculate their Semester WAM and Overall Semester WAM. 

The program takes in user input in 2 areas. 
1. The user inputs their current WAM and number of credit points related to the WAM. These inputs are used to calculate a student's Overall WAM.
2. The user inputs values for each subject including the name, mark and credit point and then presses the 'Add Subject' button. The values for each subject are added to a dynamically sized HTML table. The user, then presses the 'Calculate WAM' button. Outputs will appear at the bottom of the web page. 

Note: the program performs checks on the inputs to see if there is input and if it is in a valid range. If values are invalid, there will be an alert that appears on the user's web browser and the calculations will not be outputted.
